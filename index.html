                Chemistry begins in the stars. The
            stars are the source of the chemical elements, which are the building blocks of matter and the core of our
            subject.Chemistry can be a good and bad thing. Chemistry is good when you make love with it. Chemistry is
            bad when you make crack with it.

                A research brief is a concise summary or outline of a research project or study. A research brief is often used as a preliminary document to communicate the key aspects of a research project to stakeholders such as funders, clients, or research teams. It can also serve as a guide for researchers to ensure that they stay focused and on track throughout the research process.
                The content and format of a research brief can vary depending on the specific requirements and audience, but it should always provide a clear and accurate description of the proposed research.
